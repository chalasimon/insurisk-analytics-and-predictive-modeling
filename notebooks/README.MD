# Task 1: EDA and statistical analysis of the dataset.
Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory provide a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and initial statistical analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Files
 eda.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.
## Task Workflow
 - ***Data Loading:*** Load the dataset from the `data/` directory.
 - ***Data Overview:*** Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
 - ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*** Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends.
   - Descriptive Statistics: Calculate the variability for numerical features such as TotalPremium, TotalClaim, etc.
   - Data Structure: Review the dtype of each column to confirm if categorical variables, dates, etc. are properly formatted.
   - Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual features to understand their distributions and relationships with the target variable.
   - Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Data Comparison: Compare different features to identify patterns and insights.
   - Outlier Detection: Used box plots to identify outliers in numerical features.
   - Visualization: Use seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations for better understanding of the data.
# Task 2: Hypothesis Testing
The `a_b_hypothesis_testing.ipynb` notebook contains the hypothesis testing analysis, including statistical tests
and results interpretation.
## Task Workflow
  - ***Hypothesis Formulation:*** Define null and alternative hypotheses based on the dataset.
  - ***Statistical Tests:*** Perform appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests) to validate hypotheses.
  - ***Results Interpretation:*** Analyze the results of the tests and draw conclusions.
